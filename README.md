# Earthquake-App
You will design and make a plan to build an app to help the victims of the Nepal Earthquake. Since the strike of the earthquake, people local as well as all over the world have been trying to help in various creative ways. Would-be blood donors have posted their blood types and locations on Facebook. People looking for loved ones share photos and help each other. Can your team’s contribute the hacking skills you’ve acquired this semester to do something meaningful for the earthquake victims?
